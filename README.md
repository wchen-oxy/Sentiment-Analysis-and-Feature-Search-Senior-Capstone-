For the past several months, I have been attempting to create an effective feature based sentiment analyzer for review data. What does that mean? Well to answer a question that nobody asked…

Feature search is nothing more than just searching for information related to a specific topic. Thus, a feature search will crawl through different documents looking for instances of that topic. Sentiment analysis is also nothing more than just identifying whether a piece of text carries more negative, neutral or positive sentiment. Feature based sentiment analysis then is a combination of the two, where one searches for features, their associated descriptors and examines whether these feature are positively or negatively described.

The features that I’m searching for in particular are descriptions associated with aspects of a business. This could be several things, with acceptable examples being how the ambience of a restaurant is described and how the texture of the noodle dish is. The text I’ll be searching through to identify these features are archived, anonymized Yelp reviews.
